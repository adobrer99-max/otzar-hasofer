/**
 * The torn scroll — how the Mouth is come by.
 *
 * Peh is the one letter never found lying in an alcove. It is the mouth, the
 * opening, the letter without which the figures keeping the Houses stand
 * silent — and a power over speech should not simply be picked up off a
 * shelf. So it is *assembled*: three fragments of one torn scroll, strewn
 * through the earliest regions, which come together into the letter.
 *
 * The scroll bears the verse a Jew says immediately before the Amidah, at the
 * moment of asking to be able to speak at all — Psalms 51:17, public domain,
 * and the plainest possible statement of what the letter does.
 *
 * This also answers a scheduling problem in the ascent. Peh sat in Chesed,
 * the seventh region, which put the Dorot episodes — the richest content the
 * game draws on — behind six regions of silence. Assembling it in Malchut and
 * Yesod means the Houses speak from the second region onward, and the one
 * silent figure in Malchut becomes the reason to look for the fragments.
